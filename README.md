# PythonDataStructures
Welcome to the Python Data Structures repository! This collection features basic implementations of four fundamental data structures in Python:

List: Basic implementation of a dynamic array with append and pop operations.

Tuple: Implementation of an immutable tuple with methods to retrieve the tuple and its elements.

Dict: Simple hash map implementation allowing key-value pairs.

Set: Basic implementation of a hash set with methods for adding, removing, and checking emptiness.

Explore each data structure in its dedicated file for clear insights into their functionalities.
